ID.RA-3: Threats, both internal and external, are identified and documented
RISK ASSESSMENT
Control:
a. Conduct a risk assessment, including:
1. Identifying threats to and vulnerabilities in the system;
2. Determining the likelihood and magnitude of harm from unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the system, the information it
processes, stores, or transmits, and any related information; and
3. Determining the likelihood and impact of adverse effects on individuals arising from the
processing of personally identifiable information;
b. Integrate risk assessment results and risk management decisions from the organization and
mission or business process perspectives with system-level risk assessments;
c. Document risk assessment results in [Selection: security and privacy plans; risk assessment
report; [Assignment: organization-defined document]];
d. Review risk assessment results [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
e. Disseminate risk assessment results to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
roles]; and
f. Update the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or when there are
significant changes to the system, its environment of operation, or other conditions that may
impact the security or privacy state of the system.
Discussion: Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Risk
assessments also consider risk from external parties, including contractors who operate systems
on behalf of the organization, individuals who access organizational systems, service providers,
and outsourcing entities.
Organizations can conduct risk assessments at all three levels in the risk management hierarchy
(i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any
stage in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various
steps in the Risk Management Framework, including preparation, categorization, control
selection, control implementation, control assessment, authorization, and control monitoring.
Risk assessment is an ongoing activity carried out throughout the system development life cycle.
Risk assessments can also address information related to the system, including system design,
the intended use of the system, testing results, and supply chain-related information or artifacts.
Risk assessments can play an important role in control selection processes, particularly during
the application of tailoring guidance and in the earliest phases of capability determination

(a) Assess supply chain risks associated with [Assignment: organization-defined systems,
system components, and system services]; and
(b) Update the supply chain risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency], when there are significant changes to the relevant supply chain, or when
changes to the system, environments of operation, or other conditions may
necessitate a change in the supply chain.
Discussion: Supply chain-related events include disruption, use of defective components,
insertion of counterfeits, theft, malicious development practices, improper delivery
practices, and insertion of malicious code. These events can have a significant impact on the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system and its information and, therefore, can
also adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The
supply chain-related events may be unintentional or malicious and can occur at any point
during the system life cycle. An analysis of supply chain risk can help an organization identify
systems or components for which additional supply chain risk mitigations are required.
Related Controls: RA-2, RA-9, PM-17, PM-30, SR-2.
(2) RISK ASSESSMENT | USE OF ALL-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE
Use all-source intelligence to assist in the analysis of risk.
Discussion: Organizations employ all-source intelligence to inform engineering, acquisition,
and risk management decisions. All-source intelligence consists of information derived from
all available sources, including publicly available or open-source information, measurement
and signature intelligence, human intelligence, signals intelligence, and imagery intelligence.
All-source intelligence is used to analyze the risk of vulnerabilities (both intentional and
unintentional) from development, manufacturing, and delivery processes, people, and the
environment. The risk analysis may be performed on suppliers at multiple tiers in the supply
chain sufficient to manage risks. Organizations may develop agreements to share all-source
intelligence information or resulting decisions with other organizations, as appropriate.
Related Controls: None.
(3) RISK ASSESSMENT | DYNAMIC THREAT AWARENESS
Determine the current cyber threat environment on an ongoing basis using [Assignment:
organization-defined means].
Discussion: The threat awareness information that is gathered feeds into the organizationâ€™s
information security operations to ensure that procedures are updated in response to the
changing threat environment. For example, at higher threat levels, organizations may
change the privilege or authentication thresholds required to perform certain operations.
Related Controls: AT-2.
(4) RISK ASSESSMENT | PREDICTIVE CYBER ANALYTICS
Employ the following advanced automation and analytics capabilities to predict and
identify risks to [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components]:
[Assignment: organization-defined advanced automation and analytics capabilities].
Discussion: A properly resourced Security Operations Center (SOC) or Computer Incident
Response Team (CIRT) may be overwhelmed by the volume of information generated by the
proliferation of security tools and appliances unless it employs advanced automation and
analytics to analyze the data. Advanced automation and analytics capabilities are typically
supported by artificial intelligence concepts, including machine learning. Examples include
Automated Threat Discovery and Response (which includes broad-based collection, contextbased analysis, and adaptive response capabilities), automated workflow operations, and
machine assisted decision tools. Note, however, that sophisticated adversaries may be able

to extract information related to analytic parameters and retrain the machine learning to
classify malicious activity as benign. Accordingly, machine learning is augmented by human
monitoring to ensure that sophisticated adversaries are not able to conceal their activities.
Related Controls: None.
SECURITY ALERTS, ADVISORIES, AND DIRECTIVES
Control:
a. Receive system security alerts, advisories, and directives from [Assignment: organizationdefined external organizations] on an ongoing basis;
b. Generate internal security alerts, advisories, and directives as deemed necessary;
c. Disseminate security alerts, advisories, and directives to: [Selection (one or more):
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; [Assignment: organization-defined
elements within the organization]; [Assignment: organization-defined external
organizations]]; and
d. Implement security directives in accordance with established time frames, or notify the
issuing organization of the degree of noncompliance.
Discussion: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) generates security alerts
and advisories to maintain situational awareness throughout the Federal Government. Security
directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations with the responsibility and
authority to issue such directives. Compliance with security directives is essential due to the
critical nature of many of these directives and the potential (immediate) adverse effects on
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the
directives not be implemented in a timely manner. External organizations include supply chain

partners, external mission or business partners, external service providers, and other peer or
supporting organizations.
Related Controls: PM-15, RA-5, SI-2.
Control Enhancements:
(1) SECURITY ALERTS, ADVISORIES, AND DIRECTIVES | AUTOMATED ALERTS AND ADVISORIES
Broadcast security alert and advisory information throughout the organization using
[Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].
Discussion: The significant number of changes to organizational systems and environments
of operation requires the dissemination of security-related information to a variety of
organizational entities that have a direct interest in the success of organizational mission and
business functions. Based on information provided by security alerts and advisories, changes
may be required at one or more of the three levels related to the management of risk,
including the governance level, mission and business process level, and the information
system level.
INSIDER THREAT PROGRAM
Control: Implement an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider threat
incident handling team.
Discussion: Organizations that handle classified information are required, under Executive Order
13587 [EO 13587] and the National Insider Threat Policy [ODNI NITP], to establish insider threat
programs. The same standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified
environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of controlled unclassified
and other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include controls
to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis
of both technical and nontechnical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A
senior official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual to
implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and
analysis capability, insider threat programs require organizations to prepare department or
agency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of
individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat
awareness training to employees, receive access to information from offices in the department
or agency for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department or agency
insider threat posture.
Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams that organizations
may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources
records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some
types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace, including
ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues.
These precursors can guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts.
However, the use of human resource records could raise significant concerns for privacy. The

participation of a legal team, including consultation with the senior agency official for privacy,
ensures that monitoring activities are performed in accordance with applicable laws, executive
orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM
Control: Implement a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization informationsharing capability for threat intelligence.
Discussion: Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of adversaries,
especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it may be more likely that adversaries can
successfully breach or compromise organizational systems. One of the best techniques to
address this concern is for organizations to share threat information, including threat events (i.e.,
tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that
organizations have found are effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence
(i.e., indications and warnings about threats). Threat information sharing may be bilateral or
multilateral. Bilateral threat sharing includes government-to-commercial and government-togovernment cooperatives. Multilateral threat sharing includes organizations taking part in threatsharing consortia. Threat information may require special agreements and protection, or it may
be freely shared.
Employ automated mechanisms to maximize the effectiveness of sharing threat
intelligence information.
Discussion: To maximize the effectiveness of monitoring, it is important to know what
threat observables and indicators the sensors need to be searching for. By using well-

established frameworks, services, and automated tools, organizations improve their ability
to rapidly share and feed the relevant threat detection signatures into monitoring tools.
