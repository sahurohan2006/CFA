Cyber threat intelligence is received from information sharing forums and sources
SECURITY ALERTS, ADVISORIES, AND DIRECTIVES
Control:
a. Receive system security alerts, advisories, and directives from [Assignment: organizationdefined external organizations] on an ongoing basis;
b. Generate internal security alerts, advisories, and directives as deemed necessary;
c. Disseminate security alerts, advisories, and directives to: [Selection (one or more):
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; [Assignment: organization-defined
elements within the organization]; [Assignment: organization-defined external
organizations]]; and
d. Implement security directives in accordance with established time frames, or notify the
issuing organization of the degree of noncompliance.
Discussion: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) generates security alerts
and advisories to maintain situational awareness throughout the Federal Government. Security
directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations with the responsibility and
authority to issue such directives. Compliance with security directives is essential due to the
critical nature of many of these directives and the potential (immediate) adverse effects on
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the
directives not be implemented in a timely manner. External organizations include supply chain

partners, external mission or business partners, external service providers, and other peer or
supporting organizations.
Related Controls: PM-15, RA-5, SI-2.
Control Enhancements:
(1) SECURITY ALERTS, ADVISORIES, AND DIRECTIVES | AUTOMATED ALERTS AND ADVISORIES
Broadcast security alert and advisory information throughout the organization using
[Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].
Discussion: The significant number of changes to organizational systems and environments
of operation requires the dissemination of security-related information to a variety of
organizational entities that have a direct interest in the success of organizational mission and
business functions. Based on information provided by security alerts and advisories, changes
may be required at one or more of the three levels related to the management of risk,
including the governance level, mission and business process level, and the information
system level.
Related Controls: None.
SECURITY AND PRIVACY GROUPS AND ASSOCIATIONS
Control: Establish and institutionalize contact with selected groups and associations within the
security and privacy communities:
a. To facilitate ongoing security and privacy education and training for organizational
personnel;
b. To maintain currency with recommended security and privacy practices, techniques, and
technologies; and
c. To share current security and privacy information, including threats, vulnerabilities, and
incidents.
Discussion: Ongoing contact with security and privacy groups and associations is important in an
environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats. Groups and associations include
special interest groups, professional associations, forums, news groups, usersâ€™ groups, and peer
groups of security and privacy professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select security
and privacy groups and associations based on mission and business functions. Organizations
share threat, vulnerability, and incident information as well as contextual insights, compliance
techniques, and privacy problems consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.
THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM
Control: Implement a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization informationsharing capability for threat intelligence.
Discussion: Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of adversaries,
especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it may be more likely that adversaries can
successfully breach or compromise organizational systems. One of the best techniques to
address this concern is for organizations to share threat information, including threat events (i.e.,
tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that
organizations have found are effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence
(i.e., indications and warnings about threats). Threat information sharing may be bilateral or
multilateral. Bilateral threat sharing includes government-to-commercial and government-togovernment cooperatives. Multilateral threat sharing includes organizations taking part in threatsharing consortia. Threat information may require special agreements and protection, or it may
be freely shared.
Related Controls: IR-4, PM-12.
Control Enhancements:
(1) THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM | AUTOMATED MEANS FOR SHARING THREAT INTELLIGENCE
Employ automated mechanisms to maximize the effectiveness of sharing threat
intelligence information.
Discussion: To maximize the effectiveness of monitoring, it is important to know what
threat observables and indicators the sensors need to be searching for. By using well-

established frameworks, services, and automated tools, organizations improve their ability
to rapidly share and feed the relevant threat detection signatures into monitoring tools.
