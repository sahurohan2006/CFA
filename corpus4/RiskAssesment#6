ID.RA-5: Threats, vulnerabilities, likelihoods, and impacts are used to determine risk
SECURITY CATEGORIZATION
Control:
a. Categorize the system and information it processes, stores, and transmits;
b. Document the security categorization results, including supporting rationale, in the security
plan for the system; and
c. Verify that the authorizing official or authorizing official designated representative reviews
and approves the security categorization decision.
Discussion: Security categories describe the potential adverse impacts or negative consequences
to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals if organizational information
and systems are compromised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Security
categorization is also a type of asset loss characterization in systems security engineering
processes that is carried out throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations can
use privacy risk assessments or privacy impact assessments to better understand the potential
adverse effects on individuals. [CNSSI 1253] provides additional guidance on categorization for
national security systems.
Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an organization-wide activity with
the direct involvement of chief information officers, senior agency information security officers,
senior agency officials for privacy, system owners, mission and business owners, and information
owners or stewards. Organizations consider the potential adverse impacts to other organizations
and, in accordance with [USA PATRIOT] and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential
national-level adverse impacts.
Security categorization processes facilitate the development of inventories of information assets
and, along with CM-8, mappings to specific system components where information is processed,
stored, or transmitted. The security categorization process is revisited throughout the system
development life cycle to ensure that the security categories remain accurate and relevant.
Conduct an impact-level prioritization of organizational systems to obtain additional
granularity on system impact levels.
Discussion: Organizations apply the “high-water mark” concept to each system categorized
in accordance with [FIPS 199], resulting in systems designated as low impact, moderate
impact, or high impact. Organizations that desire additional granularity in the system impact
designations for risk-based decision-making, can further partition the systems into subcategories of the initial system categorization. For example, an impact-level prioritization on
a moderate-impact system can produce three new sub-categories: low-moderate systems,
moderate-moderate systems, and high-moderate systems. Impact-level prioritization and
the resulting sub-categories of the system give organizations an opportunity to focus their
investments related to security control selection and the tailoring of control baselines in
responding to identified risks. Impact-level prioritization can also be used to determine
those systems that may be of heightened interest or value to adversaries or represent a
critical loss to the federal enterprise, sometimes described as high value assets. For such
high value assets, organizations may be more focused on complexity, aggregation, and
information exchanges. Systems with high value assets can be prioritized by partitioning
high-impact systems into low-high systems, moderate-high systems, and high-high systems.

Alternatively, organizations can apply the guidance in [CNSSI 1253] for security objectiverelated categorization.
RISK ASSESSMENT
Control:
a. Conduct a risk assessment, including:
1. Identifying threats to and vulnerabilities in the system;
2. Determining the likelihood and magnitude of harm from unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the system, the information it
processes, stores, or transmits, and any related information; and
3. Determining the likelihood and impact of adverse effects on individuals arising from the
processing of personally identifiable information;
b. Integrate risk assessment results and risk management decisions from the organization and
mission or business process perspectives with system-level risk assessments;
c. Document risk assessment results in [Selection: security and privacy plans; risk assessment
report; [Assignment: organization-defined document]];
d. Review risk assessment results [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
e. Disseminate risk assessment results to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
roles]; and
f. Update the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or when there are
significant changes to the system, its environment of operation, or other conditions that may
impact the security or privacy state of the system.
Discussion: Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Risk
assessments also consider risk from external parties, including contractors who operate systems
on behalf of the organization, individuals who access organizational systems, service providers,
and outsourcing entities.
Organizations can conduct risk assessments at all three levels in the risk management hierarchy
(i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any
stage in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various
steps in the Risk Management Framework, including preparation, categorization, control
selection, control implementation, control assessment, authorization, and control monitoring.
Risk assessment is an ongoing activity carried out throughout the system development life cycle.
Risk assessments can also address information related to the system, including system design,
the intended use of the system, testing results, and supply chain-related information or artifacts.
Risk assessments can play an important role in control selection processes, particularly during
the application of tailoring guidance and in the earliest phases of capability determination.
(a) Assess supply chain risks associated with [Assignment: organization-defined systems,
system components, and system services]; and
(b) Update the supply chain risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency], when there are significant changes to the relevant supply chain, or when
changes to the system, environments of operation, or other conditions may
necessitate a change in the supply chain.
Discussion: Supply chain-related events include disruption, use of defective components,
insertion of counterfeits, theft, malicious development practices, improper delivery
practices, and insertion of malicious code. These events can have a significant impact on the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system and its information and, therefore, can
also adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The
supply chain-related events may be unintentional or malicious and can occur at any point
during the system life cycle. An analysis of supply chain risk can help an organization identify
systems or components for which additional supply chain risk mitigations are required.
Related Controls: RA-2, RA-9, PM-17, PM-30, SR-2.
(2) RISK ASSESSMENT | USE OF ALL-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE
Use all-source intelligence to assist in the analysis of risk.
Discussion: Organizations employ all-source intelligence to inform engineering, acquisition,
and risk management decisions. All-source intelligence consists of information derived from
all available sources, including publicly available or open-source information, measurement
and signature intelligence, human intelligence, signals intelligence, and imagery intelligence.
All-source intelligence is used to analyze the risk of vulnerabilities (both intentional and
unintentional) from development, manufacturing, and delivery processes, people, and the
environment. The risk analysis may be performed on suppliers at multiple tiers in the supply
chain sufficient to manage risks. Organizations may develop agreements to share all-source
intelligence information or resulting decisions with other organizations, as appropriate.
Related Controls: None.
(3) RISK ASSESSMENT | DYNAMIC THREAT AWARENESS
Determine the current cyber threat environment on an ongoing basis using [Assignment:
organization-defined means].
Discussion: The threat awareness information that is gathered feeds into the organization’s
information security operations to ensure that procedures are updated in response to the
changing threat environment. For example, at higher threat levels, organizations may
change the privilege or authentication thresholds required to perform certain operations.
Related Controls: AT-2.
(4) RISK ASSESSMENT | PREDICTIVE CYBER ANALYTICS
Employ the following advanced automation and analytics capabilities to predict and
identify risks to [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components]:
[Assignment: organization-defined advanced automation and analytics capabilities].
Discussion: A properly resourced Security Operations Center (SOC) or Computer Incident
Response Team (CIRT) may be overwhelmed by the volume of information generated by the
proliferation of security tools and appliances unless it employs advanced automation and
analytics to analyze the data. Advanced automation and analytics capabilities are typically
supported by artificial intelligence concepts, including machine learning. Examples include
Automated Threat Discovery and Response (which includes broad-based collection, contextbased analysis, and adaptive response capabilities), automated workflow operations, and
machine assisted decision tools. Note, however, that sophisticated adversaries may be able

to extract information related to analytic parameters and retrain the machine learning to
classify malicious activity as benign. Accordingly, machine learning is augmented by human
monitoring to ensure that sophisticated adversaries are not able to conceal their activities.
Related Controls: None.
THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM
Control: Implement a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization informationsharing capability for threat intelligence.
Discussion: Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of adversaries,
especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it may be more likely that adversaries can
successfully breach or compromise organizational systems. One of the best techniques to
address this concern is for organizations to share threat information, including threat events (i.e.,
tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that
organizations have found are effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence
(i.e., indications and warnings about threats). Threat information sharing may be bilateral or
multilateral. Bilateral threat sharing includes government-to-commercial and government-togovernment cooperatives. Multilateral threat sharing includes organizations taking part in threatsharing consortia. Threat information may require special agreements and protection, or it may
be freely shared.
Related Controls: IR-4, PM-12.
Control Enhancements:
(1) THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM | AUTOMATED MEANS FOR SHARING THREAT INTELLIGENCE
Employ automated mechanisms to maximize the effectiveness of sharing threat
intelligence information.
Discussion: To maximize the effectiveness of monitoring, it is important to know what
threat observables and indicators the sensors need to be searching for. By using well-
