ID.RA-6: Risk responses are identified and prioritized
PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES PROCESS
Control:
a. Implement a process to ensure that plans of action and milestones for the information
security, privacy, and supply chain risk management programs and associated organizational
systems:
1. Are developed and maintained;
2. Document the remedial information security, privacy, and supply chain risk
management actions to adequately respond to risk to organizational operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and
3. Are reported in accordance with established reporting requirements.
b. Review plans of action and milestones for consistency with the organizational risk
management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions.
Discussion: The plan of action and milestones is a key organizational document and is subject to
reporting requirements established by the Office of Management and Budget. Organizations
develop plans of action and milestones with an organization-wide perspective, prioritizing risk
response actions and ensuring consistency with the goals and objectives of the organization. Plan
of action and milestones updates are based on findings from control assessments and continuous
monitoring activities. There can be multiple plans of action and milestones corresponding to the
information system level, mission/business process level, and organizational/governance level.
While plans of action and milestones are required for federal organizations, other types of
organizations can help reduce risk by documenting and tracking planned remediations. Specific
guidance on plans of action and milestones at the system level is provided in CA-5.
RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
Control:
a. Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage:
1. Security risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation associated with the operation and use of organizational systems; and
2. Privacy risk to individuals resulting from the authorized processing of personally
identifiable information;
b. Implement the risk management strategy consistently across the organization; and
c. Review and update the risk management strategy [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] or as required, to address organizational changes.

Discussion: An organization-wide risk management strategy includes an expression of the
security and privacy risk tolerance for the organization, security and privacy risk mitigation
strategies, acceptable risk assessment methodologies, a process for evaluating security and
privacy risk across the organization with respect to the organizationâ€™s risk tolerance, and
approaches for monitoring risk over time. The senior accountable official for risk management
(agency head or designated official) aligns information security management processes with
strategic, operational, and budgetary planning processes. The risk executive function, led by the
senior accountable official for risk management, can facilitate consistent application of the risk
management strategy organization-wide. The risk management strategy can be informed by
security and privacy risk-related inputs from other sources, both internal and external to the
organization, to ensure that the strategy is broad-based and comprehensive. The supply chain
risk management strategy described in PM-30 can also provide useful inputs to the organizationwide risk management strategy.
