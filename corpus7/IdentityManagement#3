PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS
Control:
a. Develop, approve, and maintain a list of individuals with authorized access to the facility
where the system resides;
b. Issue authorization credentials for facility access;
c. Review the access list detailing authorized facility access by individuals [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency]; and
d. Remove individuals from the facility access list when access is no longer required.
Discussion: Physical access authorizations apply to employees and visitors. Individuals with
permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Authorization
credentials include ID badges, identification cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the
strength of authorization credentials needed consistent with applicable laws, executive orders,
directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Physical access authorizations may not
be necessary to access certain areas within facilities that are designated as publicly accessible.
Control Enhancements:
(1) PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS | ACCESS BY POSITION OR ROLE
Authorize physical access to the facility where the system resides based on position or
role.
Discussion: Role-based facility access includes access by authorized permanent and
regular/routine maintenance personnel, duty officers, and emergency medical staff.
Related Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6.
(2) PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS | TWO FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION

access to the facility where the system resides: [Assignment: organization-defined list of
acceptable forms of identification].
Discussion: Acceptable forms of identification include passports, REAL ID-compliant drivers’
licenses, and Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards. For gaining access to facilities using
automated mechanisms, organizations may use PIV cards, key cards, PINs, and biometrics.
Related Controls: IA-2, IA-4, IA-5.
(3) PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS | RESTRICT UNESCORTED ACCESS
Restrict unescorted access to the facility where the system resides to personnel with
[Selection (one or more): security clearances for all information contained within the
system; formal access authorizations for all information contained within the system; need
for access to all information contained within the system; [Assignment: organizationdefined physical access authorizations]].
Discussion: Individuals without required security clearances, access approvals, or need to
know are escorted by individuals with appropriate physical access authorizations to ensure
that information is not exposed or otherwise compromised.
PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL
Control:
a. Enforce physical access authorizations at [Assignment: organization-defined entry and exit
points to the facility where the system resides] by:
1. Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility; and
2. Controlling ingress and egress to the facility using [Selection (one or more): [Assignment:
organization-defined physical access control systems or devices]; guards];
b. Maintain physical access audit logs for [Assignment: organization-defined entry or exit
points];
c. Control access to areas within the facility designated as publicly accessible by implementing
the following controls: [Assignment: organization-defined physical access controls];
d. Escort visitors and control visitor activity [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances
requiring visitor escorts and control of visitor activity];
e. Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices;
f. Inventory [Assignment: organization-defined physical access devices] every [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency]; and
g. Change combinations and keys [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and/or when
keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or when individuals possessing the keys or
combinations are transferred or terminated.
Discussion: Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals with permanent
physical access authorizations are not considered visitors. Physical access controls for publicly
accessible areas may include physical access control logs/records, guards, or physical access
devices and barriers to prevent movement from publicly accessible areas to non-public areas.
Organizations determine the types of guards needed, including professional security staff, system
users, or administrative staff. Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, biometric
readers, and card readers. Physical access control systems comply with applicable laws, executive
orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizations have flexibility in
the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural, automated, or some combination
thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems
that require supplemental access controls, or both. Components of systems may be in areas
designated as publicly accessible with organizations controlling access to the components.
Control Enhancements:
(1) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL | SYSTEM ACCESS
Enforce physical access authorizations to the system in addition to the physical access
controls for the facility at [Assignment: organization-defined physical spaces containing
one or more components of the system].
Discussion: Control of physical access to the system provides additional physical security for
those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components.
Related Controls: None.

Perform security checks [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] at the physical
perimeter of the facility or system for exfiltration of information or removal of system
components.
Discussion: Organizations determine the extent, frequency, and/or randomness of security
checks to adequately mitigate risk associated with exfiltration.
Related Controls: AC-4, SC-7.
(3) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL | CONTINUOUS GUARDS
Employ guards to control [Assignment: organization-defined physical access points] to the
facility where the system resides 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
Discussion: Employing guards at selected physical access points to the facility provides a
more rapid response capability for organizations. Guards also provide the opportunity for
human surveillance in areas of the facility not covered by video surveillance.
Related Controls: CP-6, CP-7, PE-6.
(4) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL | LOCKABLE CASINGS
Use lockable physical casings to protect [Assignment: organization-defined system
components] from unauthorized physical access.
Discussion: The greatest risk from the use of portable devices—such as smart phones,
tablets, and notebook computers—is theft. Organizations can employ lockable, physical
casings to reduce or eliminate the risk of equipment theft. Such casings come in a variety of
sizes, from units that protect a single notebook computer to full cabinets that can protect
multiple servers, computers, and peripherals. Lockable physical casings can be used in
conjunction with cable locks or lockdown plates to prevent the theft of the locked casing
containing the computer equipment.
Related Controls: None.
(5) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL | TAMPER PROTECTION
Employ [Assignment: organization-defined anti-tamper technologies] to [Selection (one or
more): detect; prevent] physical tampering or alteration of [Assignment: organizationdefined hardware components] within the system.
Discussion: Organizations can implement tamper detection and prevention at selected
hardware components or implement tamper detection at some components and tamper
prevention at other components. Detection and prevention activities can employ many
types of anti-tamper technologies, including tamper-detection seals and anti-tamper
coatings. Anti-tamper programs help to detect hardware alterations through counterfeiting
and other supply chain-related risks.
Related Controls: SA-16, SR-9, SR-11.
(6) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL | FACILITY PENETRATION TESTING
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CA-8.]
(7) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL | PHYSICAL BARRIERS

Discussion: An access control vestibule is part of a physical access control system that
typically provides a space between two sets of interlocking doors. Vestibules are designed to
prevent unauthorized individuals from following authorized individuals into facilities with
controlled access. This activity, also known as piggybacking or tailgating, results in
unauthorized access to the facility. Interlocking door controllers can be used to limit the
number of individuals who enter controlled access points and to provide containment areas
while authorization for physical access is verified. Interlocking door controllers can be fully
automated (i.e., controlling the opening and closing of the doors) or partially automated
(i.e., using security guards to control the number of individuals entering the containment
area).
ACCESS CONTROL FOR TRANSMISSION
Control: Control physical access to [Assignment: organization-defined system distribution and
transmission lines] within organizational facilities using [Assignment: organization-defined
security controls].
Discussion: Security controls applied to system distribution and transmission lines prevent
accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such controls may also be necessary to
prevent eavesdropping or modification of unencrypted transmissions. Security controls used to
control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines include disconnected or
locked spare jacks, locked wiring closets, protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays, and
wiretapping sensors.
ACCESS CONTROL FOR OUTPUT DEVICES
Control: Control physical access to output from [Assignment: organization-defined output
devices] to prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining the output.
Discussion: Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing output devices in
locked rooms or other secured areas with keypad or card reader access controls and allowing
access to authorized individuals only, placing output devices in locations that can be monitored
by personnel, installing monitor or screen filters, and using headphones. Examples of output
devices include monitors, printers, scanners, audio devices, facsimile machines, and copiers
Control Enhancements:
(1) ACCESS CONTROL FOR OUTPUT DEVICES | ACCESS TO OUTPUT BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PE-5.]
(2) ACCESS CONTROL FOR OUTPUT DEVICES | LINK TO INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY
Link individual identity to receipt of output from output devices.
Discussion: Methods for linking individual identity to the receipt of output from output
devices include installing security functionality on facsimile machines, copiers, and printers.
Such functionality allows organizations to implement authentication on output devices prior
to the release of output to individuals.
MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS
Control:
a. Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides to detect and respond to
physical security incidents;
b. Review physical access logs [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and upon
occurrence of [Assignment: organization-defined events or potential indications of events];
and
c. Coordinate results of reviews and investigations with the organizational incident response
capability.
Discussion: Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible areas within organizational
facilities. Examples of physical access monitoring include the employment of guards, video
surveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can
help identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be
supported by audit logging controls, such as AU-2, if the access logs are part of an automated
system. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security
incidents and responses to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious
physical access activities. Suspicious physical access activities include accesses outside of normal
work hours, repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed, accesses for unusual lengths of
time, and out-of-sequence accesses
MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS | INTRUSION ALARMS AND SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT
Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides using physical intrusion
alarms and surveillance equipment.
Discussion: Physical intrusion alarms can be employed to alert security personnel when
unauthorized access to the facility is attempted. Alarm systems work in conjunction with
physical barriers, physical access control systems, and security guards by triggering a
response when these other forms of security have been compromised or breached. Physical
intrusion alarms can include different types of sensor devices, such as motion sensors,
contact sensors, and broken glass sensors. Surveillance equipment includes video cameras
installed at strategic locations throughout the facility.
MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS | AUTOMATED INTRUSION RECOGNITION AND RESPONSES
Recognize [Assignment: organization-defined classes or types of intrusions] and initiate
[Assignment: organization-defined response actions] using [Assignment: organizationdefined automated mechanisms].
Discussion: Response actions can include notifying selected organizational personnel or law
enforcement personnel. Automated mechanisms implemented to initiate response actions
include system alert notifications, email and text messages, and activating door locking
mechanisms. Physical access monitoring can be coordinated with intrusion detection
systems and system monitoring capabilities to provide integrated threat coverage for the
organization.
MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS | VIDEO SURVEILLANCE
(a) Employ video surveillance of [Assignment: organization-defined operational areas];
(b) Review video recordings [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
(c) Retain video recordings for [Assignment: organization-defined time period].
Discussion: Video surveillance focuses on recording activity in specified areas for the
purposes of subsequent review, if circumstances so warrant. Video recordings are typically
reviewed to detect anomalous events or incidents. Monitoring the surveillance video is not
required, although organizations may choose to do so. There may be legal considerations
when performing and retaining video surveillance, especially if such surveillance is in a public
location.
MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS | MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS TO SYSTEMS
Monitor physical access to the system in addition to the physical access monitoring of the
facility at [Assignment: organization-defined physical spaces containing one or more
components of the system].
Discussion: Monitoring physical access to systems provides additional monitoring for those
areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components, including server
rooms, media storage areas, and communications centers. Physical access monitoring can be
coordinated with intrusion detection systems and system monitoring capabilities to provide
comprehensive and integrated threat coverage for the organization
VISITOR ACCESS RECORDS
Control:
a. Maintain visitor access records to the facility where the system resides for [Assignment:
organization-defined time period];
b. Review visitor access records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
c. Report anomalies in visitor access records to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel].
Discussion: Visitor access records include the names and organizations of individuals visiting,
visitor signatures, forms of identification, dates of access, entry and departure times, purpose of
visits, and the names and organizations of individuals visited. Access record reviews determine if
access authorizations are current and are still required to support organizational mission and
business functions. Access records are not required for publicly accessible areas.
VISITOR ACCESS RECORDS | AUTOMATED RECORDS MAINTENANCE AND REVIEW
Maintain and review visitor access records using [Assignment: organization-defined
automated mechanisms].
Discussion: Visitor access records may be stored and maintained in a database management
system that is accessible by organizational personnel. Automated access to such records
facilitates record reviews on a regular basis to determine if access authorizations are current
and still required to support organizational mission and business functions.
VISITOR ACCESS RECORDS | PHYSICAL ACCESS RECORDS
VISITOR ACCESS RECORDS | LIMIT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ELEMENTS
Limit personally identifiable information contained in visitor access records to the
following elements identified in the privacy risk assessment: [Assignment: organizationdefined elements].
Discussion: Organizations may have requirements that specify the contents of visitor access
records. Limiting personally identifiable information in visitor access records when such
information is not needed for operational purposes helps reduce the level of privacy risk
created by a system.
