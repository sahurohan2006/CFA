Discussion: An organization-wide risk management strategy includes an expression of the
security and privacy risk tolerance for the organization, security and privacy risk mitigation
strategies, acceptable risk assessment methodologies, a process for evaluating security and
privacy risk across the organization with respect to the organizationâ€™s risk tolerance, and
approaches for monitoring risk over time. The senior accountable official for risk management
(agency head or designated official) aligns information security management processes with
strategic, operational, and budgetary planning processes. The risk executive function, led by the
senior accountable official for risk management, can facilitate consistent application of the risk
management strategy organization-wide. The risk management strategy can be informed by
security and privacy risk-related inputs from other sources, both internal and external to the
organization, to ensure that the strategy is broad-based and comprehensive. The supply chain
risk management strategy described in PM-30 can also provide useful inputs to the organizationwide risk management strategy.
