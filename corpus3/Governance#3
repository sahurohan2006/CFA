ID.GV-2: Cybersecurity roles and responsibilities are coordinated and aligned with internal roles and external partners
EXTERNAL PERSONNEL SECURITY
Control:
a. Establish personnel security requirements, including security roles and responsibilities for
external providers;
b. Require external providers to comply with personnel security policies and procedures
established by the organization;
c. Document personnel security requirements;
d. Require external providers to notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of
any personnel transfers or terminations of external personnel who possess organizational
credentials and/or badges, or who have system privileges within [Assignment: organizationdefined time period]; and
e. Monitor provider compliance with personnel security requirements.
Discussion: External provider refers to organizations other than the organization operating or
acquiring the system. External providers include service bureaus, contractors, and other
organizations that provide system development, information technology services, testing or
assessment services, outsourced applications, and network/security management. Organizations
explicitly include personnel security requirements in acquisition-related documents. External
providers may have personnel working at organizational facilities with credentials, badges, or
system privileges issued by organizations. Notifications of external personnel changes ensure the
appropriate termination of privileges and credentials. Organizations define the transfers and
terminations deemed reportable by security-related characteristics that include functions, roles,
and the nature of credentials or privileges associated with transferred or terminated individuals.
INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM PLAN
Control:
a. Develop and disseminate an organization-wide information security program plan that:
1. Provides an overview of the requirements for the security program and a description of
the security program management controls and common controls in place or planned
for meeting those requirements;
2. Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;
3. Reflects the coordination among organizational entities responsible for information
security; and
4. Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the risk being
incurred to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;
b. Review and update the organization-wide information security program plan [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: organization-defined events];
and
c. Protect the information security program plan from unauthorized disclosure and
modification.
Discussion: An information security program plan is a formal document that provides an
overview of the security requirements for an organization-wide information security program
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONTROLS
[FISMA], [PRIVACT], and [OMB A-130] require federal agencies to develop, implement, and
provide oversight for organization-wide information security and privacy programs to help
ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information processed, stored,
and transmitted by federal information systems and to protect individual privacy. The program
management (PM) controls described in this section are implemented at the organization level
and not directed at individual information systems. The PM controls have been designed to
facilitate organizational compliance with applicable federal laws, executive orders, directives,
policies, regulations, and standards. The controls are independent of [FIPS 200] impact levels
and, therefore, are not associated with the control baselines described in [SP 800-53B].
Organizations document program management controls in the information security and privacy
program plans. The organization-wide information security program plan (see PM-1) and privacy
program plan (see PM-18) supplement system security and privacy plans (see PL-2) developed
for organizational information systems. Together, the system security and privacy plans for the
individual information systems and the information security and privacy program plans cover
the totality of security and privacy controls employed by the organization.
NIST SP 800-53, REV. 5 SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROLS FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS

CHAPTER THREE PAGE 204
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5
and describes the program management controls and common controls in place or planned for
meeting those requirements. An information security program plan can be represented in a
single document or compilations of documents. Privacy program plans and supply chain risk
management plans are addressed separately in PM-18 and SR-2, respectively.
An information security program plan documents implementation details about program
management and common controls. The plan provides sufficient information about the controls
(including specification of parameters for assignment and selection operations, explicitly or by
reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the
plan and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plan is implemented as intended.
Updates to information security program plans include organizational changes and problems
identified during plan implementation or control assessments.
Program management controls may be implemented at the organization level or the mission or
business process level, and are essential for managing the organization’s information security
program. Program management controls are distinct from common, system-specific, and hybrid
controls because program management controls are independent of any particular system.
Together, the individual system security plans and the organization-wide information security
program plan provide complete coverage for the security controls employed within the
organization.
Common controls available for inheritance by organizational systems are documented in an
appendix to the organization’s information security program plan unless the controls are
included in a separate security plan for a system. The organization-wide information security
program plan indicates which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.
Events that may precipitate an update to the information security program plan include, but are
not limited to, organization-wide assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or
changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM LEADERSHIP ROLE
Control: Appoint a senior agency information security officer with the mission and resources to
coordinate, develop, implement, and maintain an organization-wide information security
program.
Discussion: The senior agency information security officer is an organizational official. For
federal agencies (as defined by applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, directives, policies,
and standards), this official is the senior agency information security officer. Organizations may
also refer to this official as the senior information security officer or chief information security
officer
