Governance and risk management processes address cybersecurity risks
ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES
Control:
a. Determine the high-level information security and privacy requirements for the system or
system service in mission and business process planning;
b. Determine, document, and allocate the resources required to protect the system or system
service as part of the organizational capital planning and investment control process; and
c. Establish a discrete line item for information security and privacy in organizational
programming and budgeting documentation.
Discussion: Resource allocation for information security and privacy includes funding for system
and services acquisition, sustainment, and supply chain-related risks throughout the system
development life cycle.
INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY RESOURCES
Control:

a. Include the resources needed to implement the information security and privacy programs
in capital planning and investment requests and document all exceptions to this
requirement;
b. Prepare documentation required for addressing information security and privacy programs
in capital planning and investment requests in accordance with applicable laws, executive
orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards; and
c. Make available for expenditure, the planned information security and privacy resources.
Discussion: Organizations consider establishing champions for information security and privacy
and, as part of including the necessary resources, assign specialized expertise and resources as
needed. Organizations may designate and empower an Investment Review Board or similar
group to manage and provide oversight for the information security and privacy aspects of the
capital planning and investment control process.
ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE
Control: Develop and maintain an enterprise architecture with consideration for information
security, privacy, and the resulting risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation.
Discussion: The integration of security and privacy requirements and controls into the enterprise
architecture helps to ensure that security and privacy considerations are addressed throughout
the system development life cycle and are explicitly related to the organization’s mission and
business processes. The process of security and privacy requirements integration also embeds
into the enterprise architecture and the organization’s security and privacy architectures
consistent with the organizational risk management strategy. For PM-7, security and privacy
architectures are developed at a system-of-systems level, representing all organizational

systems. For PL-8, the security and privacy architectures are developed at a level that represents
an individual system. The system-level architectures are consistent with the security and privacy
architectures defined for the organization. Security and privacy requirements and control
integration are most effectively accomplished through the rigorous application of the Risk
Management Framework [SP 800-37] and supporting security standards and guidelines.
Discussion: Not every function or service that a system provides is essential to
organizational mission or business functions. Printing or copying is an example of a nonessential but supporting service for an organization. Whenever feasible, such supportive but
non-essential functions or services are not co-located with the functions or services that
support essential mission or business functions. Maintaining such functions on the same
system or system component increases the attack surface of the organization’s missionessential functions or services. Moving supportive but non-essential functions to a noncritical system, system component, or external provider can also increase efficiency by
putting those functions or services under the control of individuals or providers who are
subject matter experts in the functions or services
RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
Control:
a. Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage:
1. Security risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation associated with the operation and use of organizational systems; and
2. Privacy risk to individuals resulting from the authorized processing of personally
identifiable information;
b. Implement the risk management strategy consistently across the organization; and
c. Review and update the risk management strategy [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] or as required, to address organizational changes.

Discussion: An organization-wide risk management strategy includes an expression of the
security and privacy risk tolerance for the organization, security and privacy risk mitigation
strategies, acceptable risk assessment methodologies, a process for evaluating security and
privacy risk across the organization with respect to the organization’s risk tolerance, and
approaches for monitoring risk over time. The senior accountable official for risk management
(agency head or designated official) aligns information security management processes with
strategic, operational, and budgetary planning processes. The risk executive function, led by the
senior accountable official for risk management, can facilitate consistent application of the risk
management strategy organization-wide. The risk management strategy can be informed by
security and privacy risk-related inputs from other sources, both internal and external to the
organization, to ensure that the strategy is broad-based and comprehensive. The supply chain
risk management strategy described in PM-30 can also provide useful inputs to the organizationwide risk management strategy.
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS
Control:
a. Manage the security and privacy state of organizational systems and the environments in
which those systems operate through authorization processes;
b. Designate individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities within the organizational risk
management process; and
c. Integrate the authorization processes into an organization-wide risk management program.
Discussion: Authorization processes for organizational systems and environments of operation
require the implementation of an organization-wide risk management process and associated
security and privacy standards and guidelines. Specific roles for risk management processes
include a risk executive (function) and designated authorizing officials for each organizational
system and common control provider. The authorization processes for the organization are
integrated with continuous monitoring processes to facilitate ongoing understanding and
acceptance of security and privacy risks to organizational operations, organizational assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
MISSION AND BUSINESS PROCESS DEFINITION
Control:
a. Define organizational mission and business processes with consideration for information
security and privacy and the resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and
b. Determine information protection and personally identifiable information processing needs
arising from the defined mission and business processes; and

c. Review and revise the mission and business processes [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency].
Discussion: Protection needs are technology-independent capabilities that are required to
counter threats to organizations, individuals, systems, and the Nation through the compromise
of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, or privacy). Information
protection and personally identifiable information processing needs are derived from the mission
and business needs defined by organizational stakeholders, the mission and business processes
designed to meet those needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information
protection and personally identifiable information processing needs determine the required
controls for the organization and the systems. Inherent to defining protection and personally
identifiable information processing needs is an understanding of the adverse impact that could
result if a compromise or breach of information occurs. The categorization process is used to
make such potential impact determinations. Privacy risks to individuals can arise from the
compromise of personally identifiable information, but they can also arise as unintended
consequences or a byproduct of the processing of personally identifiable information at any
stage of the information life cycle. Privacy risk assessments are used to prioritize the risks that
are created for individuals from system processing of personally identifiable information. These
risk assessments enable the selection of the required privacy controls for the organization and
systems. Mission and business process definitions and the associated protection requirements
are documented in accordance with organizational policies and procedures
