ID.BE-5: Resilience requirements to support delivery of critical services are established for all operating states (e.g. under duress/attack, during recovery, normal operations)
CONTINGENCY PLAN
Control:
a. Develop a contingency plan for the system that:
1. Identifies essential mission and business functions and associated contingency
requirements;
2. Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;
3. Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact
information;
4. Addresses maintaining essential mission and business functions despite a system
disruption, compromise, or failure;
5. Addresses eventual, full system restoration without deterioration of the controls
originally planned and implemented;
6. Addresses the sharing of contingency information; and
7. Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];
b. Distribute copies of the contingency plan to [Assignment: organization-defined key
contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements];
c. Coordinate contingency planning activities with incident handling activities;
d. Review the contingency plan for the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
e. Update the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, system, or
environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan
implementation, execution, or testing;
f. Communicate contingency plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined key
contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements];
g. Incorporate lessons learned from contingency plan testing, training, or actual contingency
activities into contingency testing and training; and
h. Protect the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
Discussion: Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program for achieving
continuity of operations for organizational mission and business functions. Contingency planning
addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes
when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the
system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be
designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans
reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need
to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery
objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.
Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown,
fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for
when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling
activities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in
the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an
incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4(5).
Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in
the IR (Incident Response) family.

Cyber Incident Response Plans, Breach Response Plans, and Occupant Emergency Plans.
Related Controls: None.
(2) CONTINGENCY PLAN | CAPACITY PLANNING
Conduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing,
telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency operations.
Discussion: Capacity planning is needed because different threats can result in a reduction
of the available processing, telecommunications, and support services intended to support
essential mission and business functions. Organizations anticipate degraded operations
during contingency operations and factor the degradation into capacity planning. For
capacity planning, environmental support refers to any environmental factor for which the
organization determines that it needs to provide support in a contingency situation, even if
in a degraded state. Such determinations are based on an organizational assessment of risk,
system categorization (impact level), and organizational risk tolerance.
Related Controls: PE-11, PE-12, PE-13, PE-14, PE-18, SC-5.
(3) CONTINGENCY PLAN | RESUME MISSION AND BUSINESS FUNCTIONS
Plan for the resumption of [Selection: all; essential] mission and business functions within
[Assignment: organization-defined time period] of contingency plan activation.
Discussion: Organizations may choose to conduct contingency planning activities to resume
mission and business functions as part of business continuity planning or as part of business
impact analyses. Organizations prioritize the resumption of mission and business functions.
The time period for resuming mission and business functions may be dependent on the
severity and extent of the disruptions to the system and its supporting infrastructure.
Related Controls: None.

minimal or no loss of operational continuity and sustains that continuity until full system
restoration at primary processing and/or storage sites.
Discussion: Organizations may choose to conduct the contingency planning activities to
continue mission and business functions as part of business continuity planning or business
impact analyses. Primary processing and/or storage sites defined by organizations as part of
contingency planning may change depending on the circumstances associated with the
contingency.

Plan for the transfer of [Selection: all; essential] mission and business functions to
alternate processing and/or storage sites with minimal or no loss of operational continuity
and sustain that continuity through system restoration to primary processing and/or
storage sites.
Discussion: Organizations may choose to conduct contingency planning activities for
alternate processing and storage sites as part of business continuity planning or business
impact analyses. Primary processing and/or storage sites defined by organizations as part of
contingency planning may change depending on the circumstances associated with the
contingency.
Related Controls: None.
(7) CONTINGENCY PLAN | COORDINATE WITH EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS
Coordinate the contingency plan with the contingency plans of external service providers
to ensure that contingency requirements can be satisfied.
Discussion: When the capability of an organization to carry out its mission and business
functions is dependent on external service providers, developing a comprehensive and
timely contingency plan may become more challenging. When mission and business
functions are dependent on external service providers, organizations coordinate contingency
planning activities with the external entities to ensure that the individual plans reflect the
overall contingency needs of the organization.
Related Controls: SA-9.
(8) CONTINGENCY PLAN | IDENTIFY CRITICAL ASSETS
Identify critical system assets supporting [Selection: all; essential] mission and business
functions.
Discussion: Organizations may choose to identify critical assets as part of criticality analysis,
business continuity planning, or business impact analyses. Organizations identify critical
system assets so that additional controls can be employed (beyond the controls routinely
implemented) to help ensure that organizational mission and business functions can
continue to be conducted during contingency operations. The identification of critical
information assets also facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources. Critical
system assets include technical and operational aspects. Technical aspects include system
components, information technology services, information technology products, and
mechanisms. Operational aspects include procedures (i.e., manually executed operations)
and personnel (i.e., individuals operating technical controls and/or executing manual
procedures). Organizational program protection plans can assist in identifying critical assets.
If critical assets are resident within or supported by external service providers, organizations
consider implementing CP-2(7) as a control enhancement.
ALTERNATE COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS
Control: Provide the capability to employ [Assignment: organization-defined alternative
communications protocols] in support of maintaining continuity of operations.
Discussion: Contingency plans and the contingency training or testing associated with those
plans incorporate an alternate communications protocol capability as part of establishing
resilience in organizational systems. Switching communications protocols may affect software
applications and operational aspects of systems. Organizations assess the potential side effects
of introducing alternate communications protocols prior to implementation.
SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES
Control: Apply the following systems security and privacy engineering principles in the
specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system and system
components: [Assignment: organization-defined systems security and privacy engineering
principles].
Discussion: Systems security and privacy engineering principles are closely related to and
implemented throughout the system development life cycle (see SA-3). Organizations can apply
systems security and privacy engineering principles to new systems under development or to
systems undergoing upgrades. For existing systems, organizations apply systems security and
privacy engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given
the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems.
The application of systems security and privacy engineering principles helps organizations
develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduces the susceptibility to disruptions,
hazards, threats, and the creation of privacy problems for individuals. Examples of system
security engineering principles include: developing layered protections; establishing security and
privacy policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development;
incorporating security and privacy requirements into the system development life cycle;
delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how
to build secure software; tailoring controls to meet organizational needs; and performing threat
modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and
compensating controls needed to mitigate risk.
Organizations that apply systems security and privacy engineering concepts and principles can
facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system
services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk management decisions. System
security engineering principles can also be used to protect against certain supply chain risks,
including incorporating tamper-resistant hardware into a design.
CRITICALITY ANALYSIS
Control: Identify critical system components and functions by performing a criticality analysis for
[Assignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or system services] at
[Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle].
Discussion: Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require significant
protections. For example, criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and
informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components
and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, directives, policies,
standards, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and
component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition of a system to
identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the
identification of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the
specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and
firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared
by many components within and external to the system.
The operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the criticality,
including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-ofsystems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical
system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities that
such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact
of a component or function failure on the organizational missions that are supported by the
system that contains the components and functions.
Criticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or
upgraded. If such analysis is performed early in the system development life cycle, organizations
may be able to modify the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and
functions, such as by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design. Criticality
analysis can also influence the protection measures required by development contractors. In
addition to criticality analysis for systems, system components, and system services, criticality
analysis of information is an important consideration. Such analysis is conducted as part of
security categorization in RA-2.
