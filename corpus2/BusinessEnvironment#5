ID.BE-4: Dependencies and critical functions for delivery of critical services are established
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
Control: Establish alternate telecommunications services, including necessary agreements to
permit the resumption of [Assignment: organization-defined system operations] for essential
mission and business functions within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when the
primary telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either the primary or alternate
processing or storage sites.
Discussion: Telecommunications services (for data and voice) for primary and alternate
processing and storage sites are in scope for CP-8. Alternate telecommunications services reflect
the continuity requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential mission and business
functions despite the loss of primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify
different time periods for primary or alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services
include additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits or lines, network-based
approaches to telecommunications, or the use of satellites. Organizations consider factors such
as availability, quality of service, and access when entering into alternate telecommunications
agreements.
Related Controls: CP-2, CP-6, CP-7, CP-11, SC-7.
Control Enhancements:
(1) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | PRIORITY OF SERVICE PROVISIONS
(a) Develop primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain
priority-of-service provisions in accordance with availability requirements (including
recovery time objectives); and
(b) Request Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used
for national security emergency preparedness if the primary and/or alternate
telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier.
Discussion: Organizations consider the potential mission or business impact in situations
where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations with similar
priority of service provisions. Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) is a Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) program that directs telecommunications service
providers (e.g., wireline and wireless phone companies) to give preferential treatment to
users enrolled in the program when they need to add new lines or have their lines restored
following a disruption of service, regardless of the cause. The FCC sets the rules and policies
for the TSP program, and the Department of Homeland Security manages the TSP program.
The TSP program is always in effect and not contingent on a major disaster or attack taking
place. Federal sponsorship is required to enroll in the TSP program.
Related Controls: None.
(2) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | SINGLE POINTS OF FAILURE
Obtain alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of sharing a single
point of failure with primary telecommunications services.
Discussion: In certain circumstances, telecommunications service providers or services may
share the same physical lines, which increases the vulnerability of a single failure point. It is
important to have provider transparency for the actual physical transmission capability for
telecommunication services.

Related Controls: None.
(3) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | SEPARATION OF PRIMARY AND ALTERNATE PROVIDERS
Obtain alternate telecommunications services from providers that are separated from
primary service providers to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.
Discussion: Threats that affect telecommunications services are defined in organizational
assessments of risk and include natural disasters, structural failures, cyber or physical
attacks, and errors of omission or commission. Organizations can reduce common
susceptibilities by minimizing shared infrastructure among telecommunications service
providers and achieving sufficient geographic separation between services. Organizations
may consider using a single service provider in situations where the service provider can
provide alternate telecommunications services that meet the separation needs addressed in
the risk assessment.
Related Controls: None.
(4) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | PROVIDER CONTINGENCY PLAN
(a) Require primary and alternate telecommunications service providers to have
contingency plans;
(b) Review provider contingency plans to ensure that the plans meet organizational
contingency requirements; and
(c) Obtain evidence of contingency testing and training by providers [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency].
Discussion: Reviews of provider contingency plans consider the proprietary nature of such
plans. In some situations, a summary of provider contingency plans may be sufficient
evidence for organizations to satisfy the review requirement. Telecommunications service
providers may also participate in ongoing disaster recovery exercises in coordination with
the Department of Homeland Security and state and local governments. Organizations may
use these types of activities to satisfy evidentiary requirements related to service provider
contingency plan reviews, testing, and training.
Related Controls: CP-3, CP-4.
(5) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | ALTERNATE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE TESTING
Test alternate telecommunication services [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
Discussion: Alternate telecommunications services testing is arranged through contractual
agreements with service providers. The testing may occur in parallel with normal operations
to ensure that there is no degradation in organizational missions or functions
POWER EQUIPMENT AND CABLING
Control: Protect power equipment and power cabling for the system from damage and
destruction.
Discussion: Organizations determine the types of protection necessary for the power equipment
and cabling employed at different locations that are both internal and external to organizational
facilities and environments of operation. Types of power equipment and cabling include internal
cabling and uninterruptable power sources in offices or data centers, generators and power
cabling outside of buildings, and power sources for self-contained components such as satellites,
vehicles, and other deployable systems.
Related Controls: PE-4.
Control Enhancements:
(1) POWER EQUIPMENT AND CABLING | REDUNDANT CABLING
Employ redundant power cabling paths that are physically separated by [Assignment:
organization-defined distance].
Discussion: Physically separate and redundant power cables ensure that power continues to
flow in the event that one of the cables is cut or otherwise damaged.
Related Controls: None.
(2) POWER EQUIPMENT AND CABLING | AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE CONTROLS
Employ automatic voltage controls for [Assignment: organization-defined critical system
components].
Discussion: Automatic voltage controls can monitor and control voltage. Such controls
include voltage regulators, voltage conditioners, and voltage stabilizers.
Related Controls: None.
References: None.
Control: Provide an uninterruptible power supply to facilitate [Selection (one or more): an
orderly shutdown of the system; transition of the system to long-term alternate power] in the
event of a primary power source loss.
Discussion: An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical system or mechanism that
provides emergency power when there is a failure of the main power source. A UPS is typically
used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical
equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious
mission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency
power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from
unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in
batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but
provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly
shut down the system.
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN
Control: Address information security and privacy issues in the development, documentation,
and updating of a critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan.
Discussion: Protection strategies are based on the prioritization of critical assets and resources.
The requirement and guidance for defining critical infrastructure and key resources and for
preparing an associated critical infrastructure protection plan are found in applicable laws,
executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.
Control: Identify critical system components and functions by performing a criticality analysis for
[Assignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or system services] at
[Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle].
Discussion: Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require significant
protections. For example, criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and
informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components
and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, directives, policies,
standards, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and
component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition of a system to
identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the
identification of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the
specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and
firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared
by many components within and external to the system.
The operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the criticality,
including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-ofsystems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical
system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities that
such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact
of a component or function failure on the organizational missions that are supported by the
system that contains the components and functions.
Criticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or
upgraded. If such analysis is performed early in the system development life cycle, organizations
may be able to modify the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and
functions, such as by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design. Criticality
analysis can also influence the protection measures required by development contractors. In
addition to criticality analysis for systems, system components, and system services, criticality
analysis of information is an important consideration. Such analysis is conducted as part of
security categorization in RA-2.
