4. Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and
5. Includes the following information to achieve system component accountability:
[Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective
system component accountability]; and
b. Review and update the system component inventory [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency].
Discussion: System components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets that
include hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations may choose to implement centralized
system component inventories that include components from all organizational systems. In such
situations, organizations ensure that the inventories include system-specific information required
for component accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability of system
components includes the system name, software owners, software version numbers, hardware
inventory specifications, software license information, and for networked components, the
machine names and network addresses across all implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6).
Inventory specifications include date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, manufacturer,
supplier information, component type, and physical location.
Preventing duplicate accounting of system components addresses the lack of accountability that
occurs when component ownership and system association is not known, especially in large or
complex connected systems. Effective prevention of duplicate accounting of system components
necessitates use of a unique identifier for each component. For software inventory, centrally
managed software that is accessed via other systems is addressed as a component of the system
on which it is installed and managed. Software installed on multiple organizational systems and
managed at the system level is addressed for each individual system and may appear more than
once in a centralized component inventory, necessitating a system association for each software
instance in the centralized inventory to avoid duplicate accounting of components. Scanning
systems implementing multiple network protocols (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6) can result in duplicate
components being identified in different address spaces. The implementation of CM-8(7) can
help to eliminate duplicate accounting of components.

Control Enhancements:
(1) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | UPDATES DURING INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL
Update the inventory of system components as part of component installations, removals,
and system updates.
Discussion: Organizations can improve the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of
system component inventories if the inventories are updated as part of component
installations or removals or during general system updates. If inventories are not updated at
these key times, there is a greater likelihood that the information will not be appropriately
captured and documented. System updates include hardware, software, and firmware
components.
Related Controls: PM-16.
(2) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED MAINTENANCE
Maintain the currency, completeness, accuracy, and availability of the inventory of system
components using [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].
Discussion: Organizations maintain system inventories to the extent feasible. For example,
virtual machines can be difficult to monitor because such machines are not visible to the
network when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain as up-to-date, complete, and

accurate an inventory as is deemed reasonable. Automated maintenance can be achieved by
the implementation of CM-2(2) for organizations that combine system component inventory
and baseline configuration activities.
Related Controls: None.
(3) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED UNAUTHORIZED COMPONENT DETECTION
(a) Detect the presence of unauthorized hardware, software, and firmware components
within the system using [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms]
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
(b) Take the following actions when unauthorized components are detected: [Selection
(one or more): disable network access by such components; isolate the components;
notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]].
Discussion: Automated unauthorized component detection is applied in addition to the
monitoring for unauthorized remote connections and mobile devices. Monitoring for
unauthorized system components may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by the
periodic scanning of systems for that purpose. Automated mechanisms may also be used to
prevent the connection of unauthorized components (see CM-7(9)). Automated mechanisms
can be implemented in systems or in separate system components. When acquiring and
implementing automated mechanisms, organizations consider whether such mechanisms
depend on the ability of the system component to support an agent or supplicant in order to
be detected since some types of components do not have or cannot support agents (e.g., IoT
devices, sensors). Isolation can be achieved , for example, by placing unauthorized system
components in separate domains or subnets or quarantining such components. This type of
component isolation is commonly referred to as “sandboxing.”
Related Controls: AC-19, CA-7, RA-5, SC-3, SC-39, SC-44, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.
(4) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ACCOUNTABILITY INFORMATION
Include in the system component inventory information, a means for identifying by
[Selection (one or more): name; position; role], individuals responsible and accountable for
administering those components.
Discussion: Identifying individuals who are responsible and accountable for administering
system components ensures that the assigned components are properly administered and
that organizations can contact those individuals if some action is required (e.g., when the
component is determined to be the source of a breach, needs to be recalled or replaced, or
needs to be relocated).
Related Controls: AC-3.
(5) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | NO DUPLICATE ACCOUNTING OF COMPONENTS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-8.]
(6) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ASSESSED CONFIGURATIONS AND APPROVED DEVIATIONS
Include assessed component configurations and any approved deviations to current
deployed configurations in the system component inventory.
Discussion: Assessed configurations and approved deviations focus on configuration settings
established by organizations for system components, the specific components that have
been assessed to determine compliance with the required configuration settings, and any
approved deviations from established configuration settings.
Related Controls: None.
(7) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY
Provide a centralized repository for the inventory of system components.

Discussion: Organizations may implement centralized system component inventories that
include components from all organizational systems. Centralized repositories of component
inventories provide opportunities for efficiencies in accounting for organizational hardware,
software, and firmware assets. Such repositories may also help organizations rapidly identify
the location and responsible individuals of components that have been compromised,
breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions. Organizations ensure that the
resulting centralized inventories include system-specific information required for proper
component accountability.
Related Controls: None.
(8) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED LOCATION TRACKING
Support the tracking of system components by geographic location using [Assignment:
organization-defined automated mechanisms].
Discussion: The use of automated mechanisms to track the location of system components
can increase the accuracy of component inventories. Such capability may help organizations
rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of system components that have
been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions. The use of
tracking mechanisms can be coordinated with senior agency officials for privacy if there are
implications that affect individual privacy.
Related Controls: None.
(9) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ASSIGNMENT OF COMPONENTS TO SYSTEMS
(a) Assign system components to a system; and
(b) Receive an acknowledgement from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
roles] of this assignment.
Discussion: System components that are not assigned to a system may be unmanaged, lack
the required protection, and become an organizational vulnerability.
PM-5:
SYSTEM INVENTORY
Control: Develop and update [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] an inventory of
organizational systems.
Discussion: [OMB A-130] provides guidance on developing systems inventories and associated
reporting requirements. System inventory refers to an organization-wide inventory of systems,
not system components as described in CM-8.
Related Controls: None.
Control Enhancements:
(1) SYSTEM INVENTORY | INVENTORY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Establish, maintain, and update [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] an
inventory of all systems, applications, and projects that process personally identifiable
information.
Discussion: An inventory of systems, applications, and projects that process personally
identifiable information supports the mapping of data actions, providing individuals with
privacy notices, maintaining accurate personally identifiable information, and limiting the
processing of personally identifiable information when such information is not needed for
operational purposes. Organizations may use this inventory to ensure that systems only
process the personally identifiable information for authorized purposes and that this
processing is still relevant and necessary for the purpose specified therein.
