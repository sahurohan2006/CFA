ID.AM-4: External information systems are catalogued
AC-20:
USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS
Control:
a. [Selection (one or more): Establish [Assignment: organization-defined terms and conditions];
Identify [Assignment: organization-defined controls asserted to be implemented on external
systems]], consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations
owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to:
1. Access the system from external systems; and
2. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems;
or
b. Prohibit the use of [Assignment: organizationally-defined types of external systems].
Discussion: External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems,
and for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required
controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned
systems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in
commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations;
systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by,
operated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems
also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and
systems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the
option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of
external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned
or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).
For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships
that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be
such that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may
not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing
information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations
or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders,
directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational
personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and
over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding
system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be
uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.
Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors
than on state, local, or tribal governments.
External systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope
of AC-20. Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in
accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and
conditions address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational

systems from external systems and the highest security category of information that can be
processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the terms and conditions with the
owners of the external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on
organizational personnel using those external systems.
Related Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, CA-3, PL-2, PL-4, SA-9, SC-7.
Control Enhancements:
(1) USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS | LIMITS ON AUTHORIZED USE
Permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the system or to process,
store, or transmit organization-controlled information only after:
(a) Verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as specified in
the organization’s security and privacy policies and security and privacy plans; or
(b) Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the
organizational entity hosting the external system.
Discussion: Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances where individuals using
external systems may need to access organizational systems. Organizations need assurance
that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage,
or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required controls have been
implemented can be achieved by external, independent assessments, attestations, or other
means, depending on the confidence level required by organizations.
Related Controls: CA-2.
(2) USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS | PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES — RESTRICTED USE
Restrict the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized
individuals on external systems using [Assignment: organization-defined restrictions].
Discussion: Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in external
systems include restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what conditions the
devices may be used.
Related Controls: MP-7, SC-41.
(3) USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS | NON-ORGANIZATIONALLY OWNED SYSTEMS — RESTRICTED USE
Restrict the use of non-organizationally owned systems or system components to process,
store, or transmit organizational information using [Assignment: organization-defined
restrictions].
Discussion: Non-organizationally owned systems or system components include systems or
system components owned by other organizations as well as personally owned devices.
There are potential risks to using non-organizationally owned systems or components. In
some cases, the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit such use (see AC-20 b.). In other cases,
the use of such systems or system components may be allowed but restricted in some way.
Restrictions include requiring the implementation of approved controls prior to authorizing
the connection of non-organizationally owned systems and components; limiting access to
types of information, services, or applications; using virtualization techniques to limit
processing and storage activities to servers or system components provisioned by the
organization; and agreeing to the terms and conditions for usage. Organizations consult with
the Office of the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using personally
owned devices, including requirements for conducting forensic analyses during
investigations after an incident.
Related Controls: None.
(4) USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS | NETWORK ACCESSIBLE STORAGE DEVICES — PROHIBITED USE

Prohibit the use of [Assignment: organization-defined network accessible storage devices]
in external systems.
Discussion: Network-accessible storage devices in external systems include online storage
devices in public, hybrid, or community cloud-based systems.
Related Controls: None.
(5) USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS | PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES — PROHIBITED USE
Prohibit the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized
individuals on external systems.
Discussion: Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in external
systems include a complete prohibition of the use of such devices. Prohibiting such use is
enforced using technical methods and/or nontechnical (i.e., process-based) methods.
PM-5:
SYSTEM INVENTORY
Control: Develop and update [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] an inventory of
organizational systems.
Discussion: [OMB A-130] provides guidance on developing systems inventories and associated
reporting requirements. System inventory refers to an organization-wide inventory of systems,
not system components as described in CM-8.
Related Controls: None.
Control Enhancements:
(1) SYSTEM INVENTORY | INVENTORY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Establish, maintain, and update [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] an
inventory of all systems, applications, and projects that process personally identifiable
information.
Discussion: An inventory of systems, applications, and projects that process personally
identifiable information supports the mapping of data actions, providing individuals with
privacy notices, maintaining accurate personally identifiable information, and limiting the
processing of personally identifiable information when such information is not needed for
operational purposes. Organizations may use this inventory to ensure that systems only
process the personally identifiable information for authorized purposes and that this
processing is still relevant and necessary for the purpose specified therein.
SA-9:
EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES
Control:
a. Require that providers of external system services comply with organizational security and
privacy requirements and employ the following controls: [Assignment: organization-defined
controls];
b. Define and document organizational oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard
to external system services; and
c. Employ the following processes, methods, and techniques to monitor control compliance by
external service providers on an ongoing basis: [Assignment: organization-defined processes,
methods, and techniques].
Discussion: External system services are provided by an external provider, and the organization
has no direct control over the implementation of the required controls or the assessment of
control effectiveness. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a
variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements,
lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain
exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services
remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires
that organizations establish and retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the
consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The
extent and nature of this chain of trust vary based on relationships between organizations and
the external providers. Organizations document the basis for the trust relationships so that the
relationships can be monitored. External system services documentation includes government,
service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements.
Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for implemented controls,
describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified
instances of noncompliance.
Related Controls: AC-20, CA-3, CP-2, IR-4, IR-7, PL-10, PL-11, PS-7, SA-2, SA-4, SR-3, SR-5.
Control Enhancements:
(1) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | RISK ASSESSMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL APPROVALS
(a) Conduct an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of
information security services; and
(b) Verify that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is
approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
Discussion: Information security services include the operation of security devices, such as
firewalls or key management services as well as incident monitoring, analysis, and response.
Risks assessed can include system, mission or business, security, privacy, or supply chain
risks.
Related Controls: CA-6, RA-3, RA-8.
(2) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS, PORTS, PROTOCOLS, AND SERVICES
Require providers of the following external system services to identify the functions, ports,
protocols, and other services required for the use of such services: [Assignment:
organization-defined external system services].

Discussion: Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions,
ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when the
need arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services
or blocking certain ports and protocols.
Related Controls: CM-6, CM-7.
(3) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH PROVIDERS
Establish, document, and maintain trust relationships with external service providers
based on the following requirements, properties, factors, or conditions: [Assignment:
organization-defined security and privacy requirements, properties, factors, or conditions
defining acceptable trust relationships].
Discussion: Trust relationships between organizations and external service providers reflect
the degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level.
Trust relationships can help organizations gain increased levels of confidence that service
providers are providing adequate protection for the services rendered and can also be useful
when conducting incident response or when planning for upgrades or obsolescence. Trust
relationships can be complicated due to the potentially large number of entities participating
in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels of trust, and
types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of trust is based on the
level of control that organizations can exert on external service providers regarding the
controls necessary for the protection of the service, information, or individual privacy and
the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of the implemented controls. The level of
control is established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or service-level
agreements.
Related Controls: SR-2.
(4) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES |CONSISTENT INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS
Take the following actions to verify that the interests of [Assignment: organizationdefined external service providers] are consistent with and reflect organizational interests:
[Assignment: organization-defined actions].
Discussion: As organizations increasingly use external service providers, it is possible that
the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational interests. In such
situations, simply having the required technical, management, or operational controls in
place may not be sufficient if the providers that implement and manage those controls are
not operating in a manner consistent with the interests of the consuming organizations.
Actions that organizations take to address such concerns include requiring background
checks for selected service provider personnel; examining ownership records; employing
only trustworthy service providers, such as providers with which organizations have had
successful trust relationships; and conducting routine, periodic, unscheduled visits to service
provider facilities.
Related Controls: None.
(5) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND SERVICE LOCATION
Restrict the location of [Selection (one or more): information processing; information or
data; system services] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations] based on
[Assignment: organization-defined requirements or conditions].
Discussion: The location of information processing, information and data storage, or system
services can have a direct impact on the ability of organizations to successfully execute their
mission and business functions. The impact occurs when external providers control the
location of processing, storage, or services. The criteria that external providers use for the
selection of processing, storage, or service locations may be different from the criteria that
organizations use. For example, organizations may desire that data or information storage

locations be restricted to certain locations to help facilitate incident response activities in
case of information security incidents or breaches. Incident response activities, including
forensic analyses and after-the-fact investigations, may be adversely affected by the
governing laws, policies, or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur
and/or the locations from which system services emanate.
Related Controls: SA-5, SR-4.
(6) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | ORGANIZATION-CONTROLLED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS
Maintain exclusive control of cryptographic keys for encrypted material stored or
transmitted through an external system.
Discussion: Maintaining exclusive control of cryptographic keys in an external system
prevents decryption of organizational data by external system staff. Organizational control
of cryptographic keys can be implemented by encrypting and decrypting data inside the
organization as data is sent to and received from the external system or by employing a
component that permits encryption and decryption functions to be local to the external
system but allows exclusive organizational access to the encryption keys.
Related Controls: SC-12, SC-13, SI-4.
(7) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | ORGANIZATION-CONTROLLED INTEGRITY CHECKING
Provide the capability to check the integrity of information while it resides in the external
system.
Discussion: Storage of organizational information in an external system could limit visibility
into the security status of its data. The ability of the organization to verify and validate the
integrity of its stored data without transferring it out of the external system provides such
visibility.
Related Controls: SI-7.
(8) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | PROCESSING AND STORAGE LOCATION — U.S. JURISDICTION
Restrict the geographic location of information processing and data storage to facilities
located within in the legal jurisdictional boundary of the United States.
Discussion: The geographic location of information processing and data storage can have a
direct impact on the ability of organizations to successfully execute their mission and
business functions. A compromise or breach of high impact information and systems can
have severe or catastrophic adverse impacts on organizational assets and operations,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Restricting the processing and storage of
high-impact information to facilities within the legal jurisdictional boundary of the United
States provides greater control over such processing and storage.
