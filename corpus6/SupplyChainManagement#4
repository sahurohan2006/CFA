ID.SC-3: Contracts with suppliers and third-party partners are used to implement appropriate measures designed to meet the objectives of an organization’s cybersecurity program and Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management Plan.
EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES
Control:
a. Require that providers of external system services comply with organizational security and
privacy requirements and employ the following controls: [Assignment: organization-defined
controls];
b. Define and document organizational oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard
to external system services; and
c. Employ the following processes, methods, and techniques to monitor control compliance by
external service providers on an ongoing basis: [Assignment: organization-defined processes,
methods, and techniques].
Discussion: External system services are provided by an external provider, and the organization
has no direct control over the implementation of the required controls or the assessment of
control effectiveness. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a
variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements,
lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain
exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services
remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires
that organizations establish and retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the
consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The
extent and nature of this chain of trust vary based on relationships between organizations and
the external providers. Organizations document the basis for the trust relationships so that the
relationships can be monitored. External system services documentation includes government,
service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements.
Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for implemented controls,
describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified
instances of noncompliance.
Related Controls: AC-20, CA-3, CP-2, IR-4, IR-7, PL-10, PL-11, PS-7, SA-2, SA-4, SR-3, SR-5.
Control Enhancements:
(1) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | RISK ASSESSMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL APPROVALS
(a) Conduct an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of
information security services; and
(b) Verify that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is
approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
Discussion: Information security services include the operation of security devices, such as
firewalls or key management services as well as incident monitoring, analysis, and response.
Risks assessed can include system, mission or business, security, privacy, or supply chain
risks.
Related Controls: CA-6, RA-3, RA-8.
(2) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS, PORTS, PROTOCOLS, AND SERVICES
Require providers of the following external system services to identify the functions, ports,
protocols, and other services required for the use of such services: [Assignment:
organization-defined external system services].

Discussion: Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions,
ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when the
need arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services
or blocking certain ports and protocols.
Related Controls: CM-6, CM-7.
(3) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH PROVIDERS
Establish, document, and maintain trust relationships with external service providers
based on the following requirements, properties, factors, or conditions: [Assignment:
organization-defined security and privacy requirements, properties, factors, or conditions
defining acceptable trust relationships].
Discussion: Trust relationships between organizations and external service providers reflect
the degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level.
Trust relationships can help organizations gain increased levels of confidence that service
providers are providing adequate protection for the services rendered and can also be useful
when conducting incident response or when planning for upgrades or obsolescence. Trust
relationships can be complicated due to the potentially large number of entities participating
in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels of trust, and
types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of trust is based on the
level of control that organizations can exert on external service providers regarding the
controls necessary for the protection of the service, information, or individual privacy and
the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of the implemented controls. The level of
control is established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or service-level
agreements.
Related Controls: SR-2.
(4) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES |CONSISTENT INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS
Take the following actions to verify that the interests of [Assignment: organizationdefined external service providers] are consistent with and reflect organizational interests:
[Assignment: organization-defined actions].
Discussion: As organizations increasingly use external service providers, it is possible that
the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational interests. In such
situations, simply having the required technical, management, or operational controls in
place may not be sufficient if the providers that implement and manage those controls are
not operating in a manner consistent with the interests of the consuming organizations.
Actions that organizations take to address such concerns include requiring background
checks for selected service provider personnel; examining ownership records; employing
only trustworthy service providers, such as providers with which organizations have had
successful trust relationships; and conducting routine, periodic, unscheduled visits to service
provider facilities.
Related Controls: None.
(5) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND SERVICE LOCATION
Restrict the location of [Selection (one or more): information processing; information or
data; system services] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations] based on
[Assignment: organization-defined requirements or conditions].
Discussion: The location of information processing, information and data storage, or system
services can have a direct impact on the ability of organizations to successfully execute their
mission and business functions. The impact occurs when external providers control the
location of processing, storage, or services. The criteria that external providers use for the
selection of processing, storage, or service locations may be different from the criteria that
organizations use. For example, organizations may desire that data or information storage

locations be restricted to certain locations to help facilitate incident response activities in
case of information security incidents or breaches. Incident response activities, including
forensic analyses and after-the-fact investigations, may be adversely affected by the
governing laws, policies, or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur
and/or the locations from which system services emanate.
Related Controls: SA-5, SR-4.
(6) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | ORGANIZATION-CONTROLLED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS
Maintain exclusive control of cryptographic keys for encrypted material stored or
transmitted through an external system.
Discussion: Maintaining exclusive control of cryptographic keys in an external system
prevents decryption of organizational data by external system staff. Organizational control
of cryptographic keys can be implemented by encrypting and decrypting data inside the
organization as data is sent to and received from the external system or by employing a
component that permits encryption and decryption functions to be local to the external
system but allows exclusive organizational access to the encryption keys.
Related Controls: SC-12, SC-13, SI-4.
(7) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | ORGANIZATION-CONTROLLED INTEGRITY CHECKING
Provide the capability to check the integrity of information while it resides in the external
system.
Discussion: Storage of organizational information in an external system could limit visibility
into the security status of its data. The ability of the organization to verify and validate the
integrity of its stored data without transferring it out of the external system provides such
visibility.
Related Controls: SI-7.
(8) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | PROCESSING AND STORAGE LOCATION — U.S. JURISDICTION
Restrict the geographic location of information processing and data storage to facilities
located within in the legal jurisdictional boundary of the United States.
Discussion: The geographic location of information processing and data storage can have a
direct impact on the ability of organizations to successfully execute their mission and
business functions. A compromise or breach of high impact information and systems can
have severe or catastrophic adverse impacts on organizational assets and operations,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Restricting the processing and storage of
high-impact information to facilities within the legal jurisdictional boundary of the United
States provides greater control over such processing and storage.
DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION
Control: Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service, at all postdesign stages of the system development life cycle, to:
a. Develop and implement a plan for ongoing security and privacy control assessments;
b. Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression] testing/evaluation
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] at [Assignment: organization-defined depth
and coverage];
c. Produce evidence of the execution of the assessment plan and the results of the testing and
evaluation;
d. Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and
e. Correct flaws identified during testing and evaluation.
Discussion: Developmental testing and evaluation confirms that the required controls are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security and privacy
policies, and meeting established security and privacy requirements. Security properties of
systems and the privacy of individuals may be affected by the interconnection of system
components or changes to those components. The interconnections or changes—including
upgrading or replacing applications, operating systems, and firmware—may adversely affect
previously implemented controls. Ongoing assessment during development allows for additional
types of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential
flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as manual code
review, security architecture review, and penetration testing, as well as and static analysis,
dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three analysis approaches.
Developers can use the analysis approaches, along with security instrumentation and fuzzing, in a
variety of tools and in source code reviews. The security and privacy assessment plans include
the specific activities that developers plan to carry out, including the types of analyses, testing,
evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components; the degree of rigor to be applied;
the frequency of the ongoing testing and evaluation; and the types of artifacts produced during
those processes. The depth of testing and evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail
associated with the assessment process. The coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the
scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts
specify the acceptance criteria for security and privacy assessment plans, flaw remediation
processes, and the evidence that the plans and processes have been diligently applied. Methods
for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate
with the security category or classification level of the system. Contracts may specify protection
requirements for documentation.
Related Controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-4, SA-3, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-15, SA-17, SI-2, SR-5, SR-6, SR-7.

(1) DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION | STATIC CODE ANALYSIS
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ
static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the
analysis.
Discussion: Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for security reviews
and includes checking for weaknesses in the code as well as for the incorporation of libraries
or other included code with known vulnerabilities or that are out-of-date and not supported.
Static code analysis can be used to identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding
practices. It is most effective when used early in the development process, when each code
change can automatically be scanned for potential weaknesses. Static code analysis can
provide clear remediation guidance and identify defects for developers to fix. Evidence of
the correct implementation of static analysis can include aggregate defect density for critical
defect types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals,
and evidence that defects were remediated. A high density of ignored findings, commonly
referred to as false positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or the
analysis tool. In such cases, organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence
from other sources.
Related Controls: None.
(2) DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION | THREAT MODELING AND VULNERABILITY ANALYSES
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform
threat modeling and vulnerability analyses during development and the subsequent
testing and evaluation of the system, component, or service that:
(a) Uses the following contextual information: [Assignment: organization-defined
information concerning impact, environment of operations, known or assumed
threats, and acceptable risk levels];
(b) Employs the following tools and methods: [Assignment: organization-defined tools
and methods];
(c) Conducts the modeling and analyses at the following level of rigor: [Assignment:
organization-defined breadth and depth of modeling and analyses]; and
(d) Produces evidence that meets the following acceptance criteria: [Assignment:
organization-defined acceptance criteria].
Discussion: Systems, system components, and system services may deviate significantly
from the functional and design specifications created during the requirements and design
stages of the system development life cycle. Therefore, updates to threat modeling and
vulnerability analyses of those systems, system components, and system services during
development and prior to delivery are critical to the effective operation of those systems,
components, and services. Threat modeling and vulnerability analyses at this stage of the
system development life cycle ensure that design and implementation changes have been
accounted for and that vulnerabilities created because of those changes have been reviewed
and mitigated.
Related controls: PM-15, RA-3, RA-5.
(3) DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION | INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT PLANS AND
EVIDENCE
(a) Require an independent agent satisfying [Assignment: organization-defined
independence criteria] to verify the correct implementation of the developer security
and privacy assessment plans and the evidence produced during testing and
evaluation; and

(b) Verify that the independent agent is provided with sufficient information to complete
the verification process or granted the authority to obtain such information.
Discussion: Independent agents have the qualifications—including the expertise, skills,
training, certifications, and experience—to verify the correct implementation of developer
security and privacy assessment plans.
Related Controls: AT-3, RA-5.
(4) DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION | MANUAL CODE REVIEWS
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a
manual code review of [Assignment: organization-defined specific code] using the
following processes, procedures, and/or techniques: [Assignment: organization-defined
processes, procedures, and/or techniques].
Discussion: Manual code reviews are usually reserved for the critical software and firmware
components of systems. Manual code reviews are effective at identifying weaknesses that
require knowledge of the application’s requirements or context that, in most cases, is
unavailable to automated analytic tools and techniques, such as static and dynamic analysis.
The benefits of manual code review include the ability to verify access control matrices
against application controls and review detailed aspects of cryptographic implementations
and controls.
Related Controls: None.
(5) DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION | PENETRATION TESTING
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform
penetration testing:
(a) At the following level of rigor: [Assignment: organization-defined breadth and depth
of testing]; and
(b) Under the following constraints: [Assignment: organization-defined constraints].
Discussion: Penetration testing is an assessment methodology in which assessors, using all
available information technology product or system documentation and working under
specific constraints, attempt to circumvent the implemented security and privacy features of
information technology products and systems. Useful information for assessors who conduct
penetration testing includes product and system design specifications, source code, and
administrator and operator manuals. Penetration testing can include white-box, gray-box, or
black-box testing with analyses performed by skilled professionals who simulate adversary
actions. The objective of penetration testing is to discover vulnerabilities in systems, system
components, and services that result from implementation errors, configuration faults, or
other operational weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration tests can be performed in
conjunction with automated and manual code reviews to provide a greater level of analysis
than would ordinarily be possible. When user session information and other personally
identifiable information is captured or recorded during penetration testing, such information
is handled appropriately to protect privacy.
Related Controls: CA-8, PM-14, PM-25, PT-2, SA-3, SI-2, SI-6.
(6) DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION | ATTACK SURFACE REVIEWS
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform
attack surface reviews.
Discussion: Attack surfaces of systems and system components are exposed areas that
make those systems more vulnerable to attacks. Attack surfaces include any accessible areas
where weaknesses or deficiencies in the hardware, software, and firmware components
provide opportunities for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities. Attack surface reviews
ensure that developers analyze the design and implementation changes to systems and

mitigate attack vectors generated as a result of the changes. The correction of identified
flaws includes deprecation of unsafe functions.
Related Controls: SA-15.
(7) DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION | VERIFY SCOPE OF TESTING AND EVALUATION
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to verify that
the scope of testing and evaluation provides complete coverage of the required controls at
the following level of rigor: [Assignment: organization-defined breadth and depth of
testing and evaluation].
Discussion: Verifying that testing and evaluation provides complete coverage of required
controls can be accomplished by a variety of analytic techniques ranging from informal to
formal. Each of these techniques provides an increasing level of assurance that corresponds
to the degree of formality of the analysis. Rigorously demonstrating control coverage at the
highest levels of assurance can be achieved using formal modeling and analysis techniques,
including correlation between control implementation and corresponding test cases.
Related Controls: SA-15.
(8) DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION | DYNAMIC CODE ANALYSIS
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ
dynamic code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the
analysis.
Discussion: Dynamic code analysis provides runtime verification of software programs using
tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption, user privilege issues, and
other potential security problems. Dynamic code analysis employs runtime tools to ensure
that security functionality performs in the way it was designed. A type of dynamic analysis,
known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by deliberately introducing malformed or
random data into software programs. Fuzz testing strategies are derived from the intended
use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications. To
understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and the assurance provided, organizations
may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (i.e., checking the degree to which the
code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or percent of
program statements called during execution of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis
(i.e., checking for words that are out of place in software code, such as non-English language
words or derogatory terms).
Related Controls: None.
(9) DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION | INTERACTIVE APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ
interactive application security testing tools to identify flaws and document the results.
Discussion: Interactive (also known as instrumentation-based) application security testing is
a method of detecting vulnerabilities by observing applications as they run during testing.
The use of instrumentation relies on direct measurements of the actual running applications
and uses access to the code, user interaction, libraries, frameworks, backend connections,
and configurations to directly measure control effectiveness. When combined with analysis
techniques, interactive application security testing can identify a broad range of potential
vulnerabilities and confirm control effectiveness. Instrumentation-based testing works in
real time and can be used continuously throughout the system development life cycle.
RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
Control:
a. Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage:
1. Security risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation associated with the operation and use of organizational systems; and
2. Privacy risk to individuals resulting from the authorized processing of personally
identifiable information;
b. Implement the risk management strategy consistently across the organization; and
c. Review and update the risk management strategy [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] or as required, to address organizational changes.

CHAPTER THREE PAGE 208
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5
Discussion: An organization-wide risk management strategy includes an expression of the
security and privacy risk tolerance for the organization, security and privacy risk mitigation
strategies, acceptable risk assessment methodologies, a process for evaluating security and
privacy risk across the organization with respect to the organization’s risk tolerance, and
approaches for monitoring risk over time. The senior accountable official for risk management
(agency head or designated official) aligns information security management processes with
strategic, operational, and budgetary planning processes. The risk executive function, led by the
senior accountable official for risk management, can facilitate consistent application of the risk
management strategy organization-wide. The risk management strategy can be informed by
security and privacy risk-related inputs from other sources, both internal and external to the
organization, to ensure that the strategy is broad-based and comprehensive. The supply chain
risk management strategy described in PM-30 can also provide useful inputs to the organizationwide risk management strategy.
