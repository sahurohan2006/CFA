ID.SC-2: Suppliers and third party partners of information systems, components, and services are identified, prioritized, and assessed using a cyber supply chain risk assessment process
SECURITY CATEGORIZATION
Control:
a. Categorize the system and information it processes, stores, and transmits;
b. Document the security categorization results, including supporting rationale, in the security
plan for the system; and
c. Verify that the authorizing official or authorizing official designated representative reviews
and approves the security categorization decision.
Discussion: Security categories describe the potential adverse impacts or negative consequences
to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals if organizational information
and systems are compromised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Security
categorization is also a type of asset loss characterization in systems security engineering
processes that is carried out throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations can
use privacy risk assessments or privacy impact assessments to better understand the potential
adverse effects on individuals. [CNSSI 1253] provides additional guidance on categorization for
national security systems.
Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an organization-wide activity with
the direct involvement of chief information officers, senior agency information security officers,
senior agency officials for privacy, system owners, mission and business owners, and information
owners or stewards. Organizations consider the potential adverse impacts to other organizations
and, in accordance with [USA PATRIOT] and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential
national-level adverse impacts.
Security categorization processes facilitate the development of inventories of information assets
and, along with CM-8, mappings to specific system components where information is processed,
stored, or transmitted. The security categorization process is revisited throughout the system
development life cycle to ensure that the security categories remain accurate and relevant.

Control Enhancements:
(1) SECURITY CATEGORIZATION | IMPACT-LEVEL PRIORITIZATION
Conduct an impact-level prioritization of organizational systems to obtain additional
granularity on system impact levels.
Discussion: Organizations apply the “high-water mark” concept to each system categorized
in accordance with [FIPS 199], resulting in systems designated as low impact, moderate
impact, or high impact. Organizations that desire additional granularity in the system impact
designations for risk-based decision-making, can further partition the systems into subcategories of the initial system categorization. For example, an impact-level prioritization on
a moderate-impact system can produce three new sub-categories: low-moderate systems,
moderate-moderate systems, and high-moderate systems. Impact-level prioritization and
the resulting sub-categories of the system give organizations an opportunity to focus their
investments related to security control selection and the tailoring of control baselines in
responding to identified risks. Impact-level prioritization can also be used to determine
those systems that may be of heightened interest or value to adversaries or represent a
critical loss to the federal enterprise, sometimes described as high value assets. For such
high value assets, organizations may be more focused on complexity, aggregation, and
information exchanges. Systems with high value assets can be prioritized by partitioning
high-impact systems into low-high systems, moderate-high systems, and high-high systems.

Alternatively, organizations can apply the guidance in [CNSSI 1253] for security objectiverelated categorization
RISK ASSESSMENT
Control:
a. Conduct a risk assessment, including:
1. Identifying threats to and vulnerabilities in the system;
2. Determining the likelihood and magnitude of harm from unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the system, the information it
processes, stores, or transmits, and any related information; and
3. Determining the likelihood and impact of adverse effects on individuals arising from the
processing of personally identifiable information;
b. Integrate risk assessment results and risk management decisions from the organization and
mission or business process perspectives with system-level risk assessments;
c. Document risk assessment results in [Selection: security and privacy plans; risk assessment
report; [Assignment: organization-defined document]];
d. Review risk assessment results [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
e. Disseminate risk assessment results to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
roles]; and
f. Update the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or when there are
significant changes to the system, its environment of operation, or other conditions that may
impact the security or privacy state of the system.
Discussion: Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Risk
assessments also consider risk from external parties, including contractors who operate systems
on behalf of the organization, individuals who access organizational systems, service providers,
and outsourcing entities.
Organizations can conduct risk assessments at all three levels in the risk management hierarchy
(i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any
stage in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various
steps in the Risk Management Framework, including preparation, categorization, control
selection, control implementation, control assessment, authorization, and control monitoring.
Risk assessment is an ongoing activity carried out throughout the system development life cycle.
Risk assessments can also address information related to the system, including system design,
the intended use of the system, testing results, and supply chain-related information or artifacts.
Risk assessments can play an important role in control selection processes, particularly during
the application of tailoring guidance and in the earliest phases of capability determination.

(a) Assess supply chain risks associated with [Assignment: organization-defined systems,
system components, and system services]; and
(b) Update the supply chain risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency], when there are significant changes to the relevant supply chain, or when
changes to the system, environments of operation, or other conditions may
necessitate a change in the supply chain.
Discussion: Supply chain-related events include disruption, use of defective components,
insertion of counterfeits, theft, malicious development practices, improper delivery
practices, and insertion of malicious code. These events can have a significant impact on the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system and its information and, therefore, can
also adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The
supply chain-related events may be unintentional or malicious and can occur at any point
during the system life cycle. An analysis of supply chain risk can help an organization identify
systems or components for which additional supply chain risk mitigations are required.
Related Controls: RA-2, RA-9, PM-17, PM-30, SR-2.
(2) RISK ASSESSMENT | USE OF ALL-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE
Use all-source intelligence to assist in the analysis of risk.
Discussion: Organizations employ all-source intelligence to inform engineering, acquisition,
and risk management decisions. All-source intelligence consists of information derived from
all available sources, including publicly available or open-source information, measurement
and signature intelligence, human intelligence, signals intelligence, and imagery intelligence.
All-source intelligence is used to analyze the risk of vulnerabilities (both intentional and
unintentional) from development, manufacturing, and delivery processes, people, and the
environment. The risk analysis may be performed on suppliers at multiple tiers in the supply
chain sufficient to manage risks. Organizations may develop agreements to share all-source
intelligence information or resulting decisions with other organizations, as appropriate.
Related Controls: None.
(3) RISK ASSESSMENT | DYNAMIC THREAT AWARENESS
Determine the current cyber threat environment on an ongoing basis using [Assignment:
organization-defined means].
Discussion: The threat awareness information that is gathered feeds into the organization’s
information security operations to ensure that procedures are updated in response to the
changing threat environment. For example, at higher threat levels, organizations may
change the privilege or authentication thresholds required to perform certain operations.
Related Controls: AT-2.
(4) RISK ASSESSMENT | PREDICTIVE CYBER ANALYTICS
Employ the following advanced automation and analytics capabilities to predict and
identify risks to [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components]:
[Assignment: organization-defined advanced automation and analytics capabilities].
Discussion: A properly resourced Security Operations Center (SOC) or Computer Incident
Response Team (CIRT) may be overwhelmed by the volume of information generated by the
proliferation of security tools and appliances unless it employs advanced automation and
analytics to analyze the data. Advanced automation and analytics capabilities are typically
supported by artificial intelligence concepts, including machine learning. Examples include
Automated Threat Discovery and Response (which includes broad-based collection, contextbased analysis, and adaptive response capabilities), automated workflow operations, and
machine assisted decision tools. Note, however, that sophisticated adversaries may be able

to extract information related to analytic parameters and retrain the machine learning to
classify malicious activity as benign. Accordingly, machine learning is augmented by human
monitoring to ensure that sophisticated adversaries are not able to conceal their activities.
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS
Control:
a. Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to follow a
documented development process that:
1. Explicitly addresses security and privacy requirements;
2. Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;
3. Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development
process; and
4. Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools
used in development; and
b. Review the development process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to determine if the process, standards, tools,
tool options and tool configurations selected and employed can satisfy the following security
and privacy requirements: [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy
requirements].
Discussion: Development tools include programming languages and computer-aided design
systems. Reviews of development processes include the use of maturity models to determine the
potential effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools and
processes facilitates effective supply chain risk assessment and mitigation. Such integrity requires
configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes
and prevent unauthorized changes.
Related Controls: MA-6, SA-3, SA-4, SA-8, SA-10, SA-11, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-6, SR-9.
Control Enhancements:
(1) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | QUALITY METRICS
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:
(a) Define quality metrics at the beginning of the development process; and
(b) Provide evidence of meeting the quality metrics [Selection (one or more):
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; [Assignment: organization-defined
program review milestones]; upon delivery].
Discussion: Organizations use quality metrics to establish acceptable levels of system
quality. Metrics can include quality gates, which are collections of completion criteria or
sufficiency standards that represent the satisfactory execution of specific phases of the
system development project. For example, a quality gate may require the elimination of all
compiler warnings or a determination that such warnings have no impact on the
effectiveness of required security or privacy capabilities. During the execution phases of
development projects, quality gates provide clear, unambiguous indications of progress.
Other metrics apply to the entire development project. Metrics can include defining the
severity thresholds of vulnerabilities in accordance with organizational risk tolerance, such

as requiring no known vulnerabilities in the delivered system with a Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS) severity of medium or high.
Related Controls: None.
(2) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | SECURITY AND PRIVACY TRACKING TOOLS
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to select and
employ security and privacy tracking tools for use during the development process.
Discussion: System development teams select and deploy security and privacy tracking
tools, including vulnerability or work item tracking systems that facilitate assignment,
sorting, filtering, and tracking of completed work items or tasks associated with
development processes.
Related Controls: SA-11.
(3) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | CRITICALITY ANALYSIS
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a
criticality analysis:
(a) At the following decision points in the system development life cycle: [Assignment:
organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle]; and
(b) At the following level of rigor: [Assignment: organization-defined breadth and depth
of criticality analysis].
Discussion: Criticality analysis performed by the developer provides input to the criticality
analysis performed by organizations. Developer input is essential to organizational criticality
analysis because organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for
system components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf products. Such design
documentation includes functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs,
source code, and hardware schematics. Criticality analysis is important for organizational
systems that are designated as high value assets. High value assets can be moderate- or
high-impact systems due to heightened adversarial interest or potential adverse effects on
the federal enterprise. Developer input is especially important when organizations conduct
supply chain criticality analyses.

ANALYSIS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-11(2).]
(5) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | ATTACK SURFACE REDUCTION
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to reduce
attack surfaces to [Assignment: organization-defined thresholds].
Discussion: Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with threat and vulnerability analyses
and system architecture and design. Attack surface reduction is a means of reducing risk to
organizations by giving attackers less opportunity to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e.,
potential vulnerabilities) within systems, system components, and system services. Attack
surface reduction includes implementing the concept of layered defenses, applying the
principles of least privilege and least functionality, applying secure software development
practices, deprecating unsafe functions, reducing entry points available to unauthorized
users, reducing the amount of code that executes, and eliminating application programming
interfaces (APIs) that are vulnerable to attacks.

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to implement
an explicit process to continuously improve the development process.
Discussion: Developers of systems, system components, and system services consider the
effectiveness and efficiency of their development processes for meeting quality objectives
and addressing the security and privacy capabilities in current threat environments.
Related Controls: None.
(7) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | AUTOMATED VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency] to:
(a) Perform an automated vulnerability analysis using [Assignment: organization-defined
tools];
(b) Determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities;
(c) Determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and
(d) Deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to [Assignment:
organization-defined personnel or roles].
Discussion: Automated tools can be more effective at analyzing exploitable weaknesses or
deficiencies in large and complex systems, prioritizing vulnerabilities by severity, and
providing recommendations for risk mitigations.
Related Controls: RA-5, SA-11.
(8) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | REUSE OF THREAT AND VULNERABILITY
INFORMATION
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to use threat
modeling and vulnerability analyses from similar systems, components, or services to
inform the current development process.
Discussion: Analysis of vulnerabilities found in similar software applications can inform
potential design and implementation issues for systems under development. Similar systems
or system components may exist within developer organizations. Vulnerability information is
available from a variety of public and private sector sources, including the NIST National
Vulnerability Database.
Related Controls: None.
(9) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | USE OF LIVE DATA
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-3(2).]
(10) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide,
implement, and test an incident response plan.
Discussion: The incident response plan provided by developers may provide information not
readily available to organizations and be incorporated into organizational incident response
plans. Developer information may also be extremely helpful, such as when organizations
respond to vulnerabilities in commercial off-the-shelf products.
Related Controls: IR-8.
(11) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | ARCHIVE SYSTEM OR COMPONENT
Require the developer of the system or system component to archive the system or
component to be released or delivered together with the corresponding evidence
supporting the final security and privacy review.

Discussion: Archiving system or system components requires the developer to retain key
development artifacts, including hardware specifications, source code, object code, and
relevant documentation from the development process that can provide a readily available
configuration baseline for system and component upgrades or modifications.
Related Controls: CM-2.
(12) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | MINIMIZE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
INFORMATION
Require the developer of the system or system component to minimize the use of
personally identifiable information in development and test environments.
Discussion: Organizations can minimize the risk to an individual’s privacy by using
techniques such as de-identification or synthetic data. Limiting the use of personally
identifiable information in development and test environments helps reduce the level of
privacy risk created by a system.
RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
Control:
a. Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage:
1. Security risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation associated with the operation and use of organizational systems; and
2. Privacy risk to individuals resulting from the authorized processing of personally
identifiable information;
b. Implement the risk management strategy consistently across the organization; and
c. Review and update the risk management strategy [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] or as required, to address organizational changes.

Discussion: An organization-wide risk management strategy includes an expression of the
security and privacy risk tolerance for the organization, security and privacy risk mitigation
strategies, acceptable risk assessment methodologies, a process for evaluating security and
privacy risk across the organization with respect to the organization’s risk tolerance, and
approaches for monitoring risk over time. The senior accountable official for risk management
(agency head or designated official) aligns information security management processes with
strategic, operational, and budgetary planning processes. The risk executive function, led by the
senior accountable official for risk management, can facilitate consistent application of the risk
management strategy organization-wide. The risk management strategy can be informed by
security and privacy risk-related inputs from other sources, both internal and external to the
organization, to ensure that the strategy is broad-based and comprehensive. The supply chain
risk management strategy described in PM-30 can also provide useful inputs to the organizationwide risk management strategy
